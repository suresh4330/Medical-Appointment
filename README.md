**Medical Appointment Management System** is a full-stack role-based appointment platform that enables patients to discover and book doctors by department, and allows doctors to manage, approve, or reject appointment requests — all through a clean, animated interface powered by Framer Motion.

- All protected routes require a valid **JWT Bearer token**
- Doctor search uses **case-insensitive** matching to prevent booking failures
